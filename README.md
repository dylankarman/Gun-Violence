# Gun Violence in The United States

In light of recent (and repetitive) mass shootings in The United States I have decided to do an analysis of where the most shootings are taking place. 

Most of the gun violence occurs in a couple of states. Illinois is an outlier in all of this due to the fact that Chicago is a hotspot for gun violence.

This is a work in progress.
